Unbelievably, nobody seemed to have made a patch for this yet. So I made it.

Sometimes I feel bad replacing Reimu & co. for these patches. But ahh well.

Thanks for playing this patch if you're reading this. To be honest, I don't know how many people download these. If you're seeing this try to contact me on discord with KogasaðŸ“ˆ#8100

This is my third patch so far. I am learning a little more and more each time. It's pretty fun, but sometimes tedious.

PS. I know that Rin's sprite is just a poster girl, but what else would I use? Also some things seem to be hardcoded like shot type.

Here is my attempt at a Character Profile, hopefully it's not too cringy.

Enigmatic and Unseen Person
Rin Satsuki

Ability: Manipulating Flowers and Wind (Although not to the extent of Yuuka or Aya)

A strange person with little known about her. On this particular day she seemed to try to take up the hobby of youkai hunting.

She seems to have an affinity for Cherries, having them in her bow and always has an erhu in her hands. The extent of her knowledge of this is unknown.

She seems to have some memory issues as well. Or maybe she's just pretending..?
